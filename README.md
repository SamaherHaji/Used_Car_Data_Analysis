Title: Used Car Price Analysis and Insights

Description:
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of a used car dataset. The goal is to uncover trends, relationships, and insights that impact car prices based on factors like mileage, manufacturer, condition, fuel type, and more.

The project includes:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and irrelevant columns.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generating visualizations to analyze trends and relationships.
Key Findings: Insights into factors affecting car prices, state-level comparisons, and popular car types.
The analysis is performed in Python using libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The visualizations help in understanding how factors like odometer readings, car conditions, and manufacturer influence pricing.
